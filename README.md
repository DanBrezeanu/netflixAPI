## Netflix API Manager

Build a database with the titles and genres from the Netflix streaming platform.

The project relies on the [*uNoGS* API](rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs).

### *uNoGS* API Requirements

* [Create](https://rapidapi.com) an account and subscribe to the *uNoGS* API
  > You can opt for the (free) Basic plan. The database updates (and creation) will be optimized to query the API no more than 100 times per day 
* Copy the API key to the file specified in the `settings` file (**default:** `api.key`)
  > ⚠️ **Do not upload the API key file on public repositories!**
